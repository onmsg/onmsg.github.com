        <h3>What Is OnMsg?</h3>

<p>OnMsg is product of a years-long search for a mail and news system that was flexible, searchable, fast, and not frustrating to use.  It relies on lightweight local servers so that your messages are always available, and fast to search.  Although many of the ideas are easily adaptable to other platforms, we've focused on a configuration that works on MacOS, and we give particular attention to configuration for Gnus.  If you're using a different mail or news client and you still want local servers, you can use that part of the instructions.</p>

<h3>Why for Hackers?</h3>

<p>You'll be setting up local servers!  You'd better be prepared to do some system configuration, at least in the beginning.  After that, it seems to "just work."</p>
