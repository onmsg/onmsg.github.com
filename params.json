It relies on lightweight local servers so that your messages are always available, and fast to search.  Although many of the ideas are easily adaptable to other platforms, we've focused on a configuration that works on MacOS, and we give particular attention to configuration for Gnus.  If you're using a different mail or news client and you still want local servers, you can use that part of the instructions.\r\n\r\n### Why for Hackers?\r\n\r\nYou'll be setting up local servers!  You'd better be prepared to do some system configuration, at least in the beginning.  After that, it seems to \"just work.\"\r\n\r\n### Where is it?\r\n\r\nFind us on GitHub at http://github.com/onmsg/onmsg"}
